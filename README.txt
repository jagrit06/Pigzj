BlockingMap:
    - ConcurrentHashMap with block index as queue and BlockingQueues as value
    - Maintains queues of only size 1 for output buffers
    - When output buffer requested with a given index, queue[index].take() is called
        This blocks the method till output buffer of index is put into the BlockingMap
        Helps maintain order while writing output
    A similar strucutre was suggested on piazza: 
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23917818/concurrenthashmap-wait-for-key-possible
    Changes were made to make it closer to MessAdmin does with their BlockingQueue

Writer:
    - Handles the only shared variables between blocks 
    - Maintains BlockingMap between block index and output buffer
    - Maintains AtomicIntegerArray to store the amount of relevants 
        bytes in each output buffer (will beupdated in parallel) 
    - BlockCompressor can ask writer to note completed output buffer
        Adds them to BlockingMap with corresponding index
        (called in parallel)
    - Can write out all the blocks stored in BlockingMap and checks for errors 

BlockCompressor:
    - Runnable, run() is executed in parallel
    - Reads in 1 block from stdin
    - Updates crc while reading (so it is done in order)
    - Gets dictionary from previous block if exists
    - Has its own Deflater object
    - Compresses input in run() and sends output to be stored by writer

MultiThreadedCompressor:
    - Handles all overhead such as writing headers and trailers 
    - Makes the thread pool
    - Makes batches of num_threads blocks and compresses them in parallel
        * Each batch gets its own Writer
        * Each batch creates num_threads blocks and gets one block from the prev batch (for dict)
        * Each batch compresses num_threads blocks and passes its last block to the next batch
        * Compression happens by usung the threadpool 
        * Once compression is complete, output for the batch is written and we move to the next 

        Assuming we have 5 threads:

        Read by prev batch|            Read by this batch                   |   Read by next batch
            ... | Block 0 | Block 1 | Block 2 | Block 3 | Block 4 | Block 5 | ... 
                |             Compressed by this batch            |     Compressed by next batch

    The idea of reading in a batch at a time is inspired from pigz

Pigzj
    - Main class
    - Handles command line arguments
    - Call MultiThreadedCompressor to compress

Section 1: Testing set up
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Linux server used: lnxsrv15
PATH starts with /usr/local/cs/bin
Java version: openjdk version "16.0.1"
pigz version: pigz 2.6
gzip version: gzip 1.10

Tests were conducted on a large file (java source modules), a medium file
(pigz source code) and a tiny file (small self made tiny file, which should 
just be one block) to compare time and space efficiency. The same tests were 
repeated for pigz and Pigzj with thread counts speicifed to 4 and 2. 

An empty file was tested as well as a sanity check to ensure all the basic
required overhead is coorectly inserted by all the 3 programs. The 
decompression output for Pigzj was also checked against the original input.

Comparing Times:

The performance of Pigzj is closer to that of pigz than gzip on the large files
as required. For larger sized files and many threads, pigz compresses the fatest, 
with Pigzj close behind and gzip taking the longest. The parallel programs 
however suffer in smaller files.

Looking at the number of threads, as expected, pigz and Pigzj get slower with a 
lower number of threads, and suffer. Pigzj is slower than pigz on tiny files
with a low no. of threads, but in such situations, gzip maybe better suited.

=========================================================

Comparing Sizes:

The size differences between the compressed outputs of Pigzj and pigz are not 
siginificant. Like the spec requires, the output  of Pigzj is closer to the 
output of pigz than gzip. The compression ratios between Pigzj and pigz on all 
files (up to a precision of 3 decimals) are the same.  

The compressed outputs of Pigzj and pigz are smaller than the output of gzip 
(becuase both use pigz's ditionary trick) for larger files. For smaller files, 
gzip gives better compresion (which is to be expected, pigz and Pigzj are 
designed for larger files). 

A difference in number of threads does not affect the size of the compressed output
which is the same for each run on a given file, which is expected behavior.

Section 3: Understanding the differences

strace was run on the 3 programs compressing the large file
(since that is where the differences were most pronounced). 

Note: The summaries presented are with the wall clock time flag speicifed.

From these results, the differences in performances are apparent:

  - gzip spends most of its time in the user level where the compression occurs
    and mostly switches modes for (relatively frequent) read and write calls. 
    Most of its time is spend in it single threadedly compressing the data.

  - pigz spends a siginificant amount of system call time on a futex lock
    which is to be expected since it handles multithreading. It also spends 
    a more time than Pigzj on read call (possibly because how read buffering
    differ in Java interpreter/gcc)

  - Pigzj spends a very high amount of its system call time on futex locks. 
    This probably corresponds to the use of data structures such as 
    AtomicIntegerArray, BlockQueue and ConcurrentHashMaps, and also since 
    Pigzj forces threads to finsih their compression tasks before writing 
    the compressed buffers to stdout. It spends less time in other system 
    calls such as read (as above, possibly becuase of the stdin buffering)

In net, both Pigzj and pigz spend a large amount of time in lock, which indicates
the similarity in their structures. Further, the fact that Pigzj spends more time
with a lock (by about 0.5-0.6s for this particular file) matches exactly with it 
taking more time to finish up the compression (it is usually slower by 0.6s). 

=========================================================

I suspect that slight difference in the compressed outputs comes from the 
compression flags I used in the Deflater (SYNC_FLUSH), which was the same as 
the given starter code. Since it give almost similar results and could 
successfully be decompressed by pigz for inputs of different sizes, that 
wasn't changed.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Section 4: Problems in scaling Pigzj
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

In its current form, the Pigzj implementation should be able to handle larger files 
at good speeds (even if not as fast as pigz, it will be much faster than gzip). 
This is because we only have atmost num_threads + 1 block in memory, which should
be viable for most machines. 

Increasing the number of threads dramatically could add addtional time Pigzj spends 
in locks which could slow it down since for every batch of num_threads blocks, 
Pigzj must wait till each thread is done with its tasks before writing out the output
and only then can it read the next blocks for compression (pigz does similar). 
It could be useful for very big files where there are enough batches to justify the 
overhead costs of the many threads and handling them. 

It is however to be noted that the Pigzj will be more secure than pigz and portable
on different machines (which is why we wrote in Java in the first place). So, if
sacirificing just a little performance is viable, Pigzj would be the right choice for 
larger files on a system with multiple cores.
